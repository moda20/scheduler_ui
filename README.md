## 📖 Overview

Scheduler UI is a modern React-based web application that provides a clean, intuitive interface for managing the [Scheduler Backend](#). It enables seamless management of tasks, authentication, proxies, databases, and other system configurations.

### Key Features

- **Task Management**: Create, monitor, and control scheduled jobs with detailed execution history
- **Proxy Management**: Configure and manage proxy servers for task execution
- **Database Management**: Handle database connections and configurations
- **Event Logging**: View detailed execution logs and event streams
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)

The recommended deployment method uses Docker with nginx as a reverse proxy.

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker compose up

# Or run the container directly
docker run -p 80:80 ghcr.io/moda20/scheduler_ui:latest
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variable can be set at build time:

| Variable          | Description                               | Default |
| ----------------- |-------------------------------------------| ------- |
| `SERVER_ENDPOINT` | The default endpoint of the target server | `/`     |

### Example Docker Compose

A `compose.yml` file is included in the repository for reference. The recommended setup is to deploy the UI alongside an instance of the scheduler backend (see the [starter repo](#)).
